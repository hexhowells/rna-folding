nucleotide - RNA/DNA base / letters
ribose-phosphate chain - the backbone of RNA
watson-crick pairing - the fact that bases connect into known pairs, A<->U & G<->C
ligand - a molecule that binds specifically to a receptor or target protein to trigger a biological response
free energy - the amount of energy released or required during the formation of RNA secondary structures, indicating their stability
conformation - the specific three-dimensional shape or arrangement of atoms in a molecule
conformational landscape - the range of possibile shapes a molecule can adopt, along with the associated energy levels of each shape
residue - A single unit, such as an amino acid or necleotide, that remains part of a larger biological molecule after it forms
monomer - a small molecule that can bond with other molecules to form a larger, more complex molecule called a polymer
isoform - A slightly different version of the same protein or gene, often produced by alternative splicing or genertic variation
coevolution - The process in which interacting RNA molecules or regions within RNA sequences evolve together to maintain their structure or functional relationships
